If you'd like to contribute to StackSorted (submitting a PR, opening an issue, adding a site or link, etc.), please keep these simple rules in mind.

1. This project intends to collect the best, most creative designs on the web. So please don't submit generic 'component' designs.
2. If you'd like to make massive changes to the code base, please discuss it by opening an issue first.
3. We can all have our own opinions when it comes to the design of the StackSorted UI. So if you have any suggestions to improve the UI/UX while keeping them in line with the branding, make sure to submit them! However, UI suggestions that don't make any meaningful improvements (like adding random icons, hover effects, etc.) will likely not be merged. You are still free to discuss them with others.
4. If you'd like to link to your implementation of a design, please keep in mind that only CodePen links are accepted for now.
5. We can all grow together by sharing our work (design or code) on this project. That's absolutely fine. So please be sincere with your submissions.

I appreciate you taking the time to improve this project!
